# Advent of Code

Repository with personal solutions for Advent of code puzzles.
I take these puzzles as an opportunity to experiment with and learn something new, the solutions will most likely be poorly written.

## Input

Day inputs themselves have been deleted, instructions on how to add input files should be in each years readme.
